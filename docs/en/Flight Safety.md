Aircraft Inspection

Regularly inspecting a quadcopter is crucial for ensuring safe and reliable operation. Pre-flight and post-flight checks help identify potential issues such as loose or damaged propellers, faulty wiring, low battery levels, or structural cracks that could lead to in-flight failures. To perform an inspection, start by checking the frame for any visible damage, ensuring the motors spin freely and without obstruction. Inspect the propellers for cracks or warping, and confirm all screws and fasteners are secure. Verify that the battery is fully charged and properly connected. Finally, test the flight controls and calibrate sensors if necessary to ensure stable operation before takeoff.

Before you start:

1. Check the Prop Guards – Ensure the propeller guards are securely attached and free from cracks or damage. Loose or broken guards can affect flight stability and safety.
2. Inspect the Cover Shield – Examine the body or protective cover for any cracks, dents, or loose components. A damaged cover can expose internal electronics to dust, moisture, or impact damage.
3. Examine the Propellers – Look for any chips, cracks, or warping in the blades. Spin each propeller manually to check for smooth movement without resistance. Replace damaged propellers immediately.
4. Check the Motors – Rotate each motor by hand to ensure they spin freely without unusual noise or resistance. Listen for grinding sounds, which may indicate dirt buildup or internal damage.
5. Inspect the Landing Gear – Ensure the landing gear is properly attached and not cracked or bent. Damaged landing gear can cause instability during takeoff and landing.
6. Check the Battery – Verify that the battery is fully charged and securely connected. Look for any swelling, leaks, or damage that could indicate a faulty or dangerous battery.
7. Inspect the Downward-Facing Sensor – Clean the sensor with a soft cloth to remove dust or debris that could affect altitude hold and landing accuracy. Test the sensor by hovering at a low altitude to confirm proper function.

> **Caution** An unsecure battery or prop guard could cuase complete aircraft failure and damage. 


Flights
-------

### Safety during pre-flight preparations

* Make sure that the Li-ion batteries are charged.
* Make sure the batteries in the control equipment are charged.
* Attach the propellers just before flying.

Check the following:

* Tightness of propeller nuts.
* Attachment and integrity of propellers guards.

### Safety before flight

* Place the spectators behind the pilot, or behind the line passing through both shoulders of the pilot behind the pilot.
* Do not allow spectators into the hemisphere in front of the pilot.
* Know and remember the flight duration that the copter and its battery are designed for.
* BEFORE connecting the Li-ion battery enable control equipment (the remote), and set the left stick (throttle) to the zero position.
* Connect the Li-ion battery immediately before takeoff, disconnect it immediately after landing.
* Stay at least 3 m away from the aircraft.
* Take off from a level flat site at a safe distance away from obstacles.

### Flight safety

* Follow all instructions of the teacher or the flight instructor.
* Specify the flying area in advance. Only fly in the specified area, and avoid flying outside it. Not to fly over behind your back.
* When learning to fly, fly below the level of your height.
* Fly in proximity to yourself at a distance at which you can see the aircraft orientation in space. Do no fly far away from yourself. If you doubt the aircraft's orientation, immediately land on the spot. Do not try to take off. Approach the aircraft and take off.
* During the flight, move the control sticks carefully and smoothly. Avoid abrupt movements. If you have to change the flight direction, move the sticks vigorously, but not abruptly.
* Fly carefully, and perform only those flight elements that you are sure you can perform. Never perform the flight maneuvers that you doubt you can perform, and the maneuvers involving risks.
* Observe the speed limit. The aircraft speed should be maintained within the speed of a walking man.
* Return the aircraft to the landing location by the estimated time, prevent complete discharge of the battery during the flight.
* Land only on a flat open area away from obstacles

### Emergency landing

In case of hitting the ground or a heavy landing, do the following:

1. Stop the flight. Land the aircraft on the ground. Set the left stick (throttle) to the minimum
2. Disarm (Move the left stick left-down for 3 seconds)
3. Disconnect the Li-ion battery on the aircraft.
4. Turn off the remote.
5. Inspect the aircraft, and repair if necessary.

### Scheduled landing

After a scheduled landing, do the following:

1. Disarm (Move the left stick left-down for 3 seconds)
2. Disconnect the Li-ion battery on the aircraft.
3. Turn off the remote.
