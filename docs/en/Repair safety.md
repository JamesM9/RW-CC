Soldering and tinning should be performed in specially prepared rooms. A ventilation system and a fume extractor are mandatory.

Before you start:

1. Prepare your workplace. Nothing should interrupt the process. Your workbench should be well lit.
2. Check the integrity of wiring and plugs of all electrical appliances.
3. Place your soldering iron near the fume extractor. Use a soldering iron stand when the soldering iron is not in use.
4. Wear safety goggles and gloves.

During soldering:

1. Use the soldering iron grip to hold the soldering iron. The tip is very hot!

2. The soldering iron tip can easily damage insulation which may lead to short circuits.
3. Use pliers, tweezers and other tools to safely handle wires and boards during soldering.
4. Do not pull wires too hard during desoldering operations to avoid burns by molten solder.
5. Use a special holder (a "helping hand") for soldering small components.

6. Don't hold the soldering iron by its wire or tip. Unplug the iron during breaks and after work.

> **Caution** Unplug the soldering iron in case of malfunctions and/or fire.

Rosin and solder emit a considerable amount of harmful substances when heated. Vent the room after each soldering session. Take breaks every 30 minutes for full room ventilation; don't forget to unplug the soldering iron during these breaks.
