**droid** is an educational kit of a programmable quadcopter that consists of popular open source components, and a set of necessary documentation and libraries for working with it.

The kit includes a [Reality Works Pix](Reality Works_pix.md) flight controller with the PX4 flight stack, a [Raspberry Pi 4](raspberry.md) as a controlling onboard computer, and a [camera module](camera.md) for performing flights with the use of computer vision, as well as a set of various sensors and other peripherals.

The droid platform contains a [pre-configured image for Raspberry Pi](image.md) with the full set of required software for working with peripheral devices and [programming autonomous flights](simple_offboard.md). The source code of the platform and of the documentation is open and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/CopterExpress/droid).
